      <h2>What are LLMs?</h2>
      <p>
        LLMs, or Large Language Models, are a class of artificial intelligence (AI) models that have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) tasks. These models are designed to understand and generate human-like text based on vast amounts of training data.
      </p>
      <p>
        At their core, LLMs are deep learning models that use a neural network architecture to process and generate text. They are trained on large datasets containing billions of words from diverse sources such as books, articles, websites, and more. The training process involves exposing the model to this vast amount of text data and teaching it to understand the nuances of language, including grammar, semantics, and context.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the key features of LLMs is their ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text. By leveraging the patterns and structures present in the training data, LLMs can generate text that mimics human writing to a remarkable degree. This capability has led to various applications across multiple domains, including language translation, text summarization, question answering, and more.
